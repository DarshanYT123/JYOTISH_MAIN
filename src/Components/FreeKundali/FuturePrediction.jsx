          <p className="text-[color:var(--Black-text-color,#3A3A3A)] text-start text-[16px] font-Poppins not-italic font-normal leading-7 tracking-[0.48px]">First of all, the credit for astrology and the predictions we make here being so accurate goes to the 100s of learned and astrologically-versed astrologers we have on board. And to answer what makes astrology so accurate, then it is the pure knowledge of our astrologers about the planets, planetary configurations, constellations and learning of how they influence human life and behaviour as they move, shift or even stay still. Astrology is not some random guesswork but science that entails scientific principles that were sketched by learned Gurus 1000s of years ago and have not changed to date. These gurus studied the movement of planets and how their aura influences the life of people on earth. The antiquity of astrology is revealed from the fact that millions of people continue to stay connected with it due to the accuracy it has to offer. Astrology has changed the lives of millions of people through us and many other astrologers.</p>
